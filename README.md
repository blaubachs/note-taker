# Note Taker

## Description

This application was created to be able to easily take notes and save them to a file linked in the backend using express js. I learned a lot about writing routes in express, and being able to fetch from the front end.

## Usage

To use this app, you click the button on the landing page to be taken to a page to write your notes. You can then enter a title for the note, and content for the note. The save button will save the note, and the delete button in the column on the left will remove it. You can view other notes by clicking on their respective titles.
